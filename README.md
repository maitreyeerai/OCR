An optical recognition system built using K nearest neighbour algorithm 

The data used in the OCR is the MNIST dataset ( http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ )

The OCR_Fashion.ipynb is the same OCR system but is trained using the Fashion-MNIST dataset  ( https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist )
